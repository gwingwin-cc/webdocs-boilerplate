### Easy start and ready to development web-docs.

By use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)  for creating web document site this is boilerplate not complete project, easy to start and full customization

In deployment production can use web hosting eg. [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

see example  https://webdocs-boilerplate-zafzcf56m-gwingwin.vercel.app/

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn

yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
